# State of Literacy among Men & Women in Uttarakhand (Census 2011)

The Supreme Court on 4th November 2022 lifted the stay imposed by the Uttarakhand High Court on a 2006 order giving 30% reservation to women having domicile of the state in state civil services. The analysis below tries to determine whether the decision was correct given the state of literacy in Uttarakhand.

## 1. Basics
The charts for each district showcase two horizontal bar graphs:
* First, for literate men and women.
* Second, for illiterate men and women. 

The x-axis represents the percentage while the y-axis shows the various development blocks in the district.

## 2. Observation -I
I found some people claiming that since a decent number of women have become educated, it is now time to scrap women's quotas. To test this, I compared the state of men & women among Literates and Illiterates as can be seen below:

We observe that among the literates, the difference between men and women isn't much. But as we dive into the realm of illiterates, we find that illiterate women are almost double in number than illiterate men.
And friends, this is how **Sample Selection Bias** fools us. People who advocate removing special provisions for women only focus on the sample of literate men & women. But once the sample changes to illiterates, the truth comes forefront.
